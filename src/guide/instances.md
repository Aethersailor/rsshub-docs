# Public Instances

Although the official instances are already stable enough, in order to achieve decentralization, we encourage users to host their own RSSHub instances or use other public RSSHub instances.

If you are willing to contribute your own instance for others to use, please edit [this file](https://github.com/RSSNext/rsshub-docs/edit/main/.vitepress/theme/components/InstanceList.vue) and submit a PR to add your instance to the list.

## Official

## Folo

[Folo](https://github.com/RSSNext/Folo) offers numerous user-shared instances that you can switch between and use with just one click. However, these instances are not compatible with external readers. Additionally, you can share your own instances on Folo to earn tokens.
